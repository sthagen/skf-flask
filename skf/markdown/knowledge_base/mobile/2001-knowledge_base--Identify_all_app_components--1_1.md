##Description:

It's important to review all the application components as we want to remove the unused components in the release of the application. The more code and components in here increases the risk of the application and the possibity that it can be abused by an attacker, the goal is to minimize the attack surface.

##Mitigation:

Review the application on the components that are being imported and the usage of those and if necerry remove unused components.
